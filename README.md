## App Summary
##### This app is a translator app. What this app can do is that its based on travel related sources. For e.g. if you are going to a foreign country and don't know their language, there are many languages to choose on.

## Get Started
##### When getting started in react-native, you need to install the following things:
+ Install the latest version Nodejs (if you have)
+ Install React-Native 


## Link
**react-native documentation will guide you through the process of each installation** https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup/ (enable to see link)

## Install React Native

##### Before you install react-native you need to download the dependencies (on macOs)

```
brew install node
brew install watchman
```

#### Xcode
  + The easiest way to install Xcode is via the Mac App Store. Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.

  + If you have already installed Xcode on your system, make sure it is version 10 or newer.

  + Command Line Tools
      - You will also need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Open Xcode, then choose "Preferences..." from the Xcode menu. Go to the Locations panel and install the tools by selecting the most recent version in the Command Line Tools dropdown.



### Installing an iOS Simulator in Xcode
  + To install a simulator, open Xcode > Preferences... and select the Components tab. Select a simulator with the corresponding version of iOS you wish to use.

### CocoaPods
  + CocoaPods is built with Ruby and it will be installable with the default Ruby available on macOS. You can use a Ruby Version manager, however we recommend that you use the standard Ruby available on macOS unless you know what you're doing.

  + Using the default Ruby install will require you to use sudo when installing gems. (This is only an issue for the duration of the gem installation, though.)

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

#### React Native Command Line Interface
React Native has a built-in command line interface. Rather than install and manage a specific version of the CLI globally, we recommend you access the current version at runtime using npx, which ships with Node.js. With npx react-native <command>, the current stable version of the CLI will be downloaded and executed at the time the command is run.


### Creating a new application

```
npx react-native init <Project Name>
```

#### Running your React Native application

```
npx react-native start
```

### Start your application in any emulator
IOS
```
npx react-native run-ios
```
Android
```
npx react-native run-android
```

## Cloning Project

In your command line, clone and run your project

```
# Clone the project
git clone <your project site>

# Go into the repo
cd <project name>

# Start the project
npx react-native start
```
